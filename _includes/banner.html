	The goal of the Video LINCS program, is to research and develop novel capabilities to autonomously re-identify objects across diverse video sensor collections and map all objects to a common reference frame. Re-identification (reID) is the process of matching the same object across a video collection, to determine where the object appears throughout the video. Video LINCS will research approaches that will facilitate autonomous reID in an open-world setting where there is no advance knowledge of the sensors, scene, content, or video collection geometries. ReID technologies will initially be developed for specific object classes that are known in advance, such as people and vehicles, and ultimately extend to all objects in the video footage without advance knowledge of specific object types. The capability to autonomously remap object locations from individual camera reference frames to a single common reference frame, nominally a geo-reference frame (geo-localization), will also be developed.
